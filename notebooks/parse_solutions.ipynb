For example, let X denote the temperature at noon tomorrow outside the building in which the class is being held. Have each student determine a number $x_{1}$ such that the student considers the following two possible outcomes to be equally likely: $X \\\\leq x_{1}$ and $X>x_{1}$. Also, have each student determine numbers $x_{2}$ and $x_{3}$ (with $x_{2}<x_{3}$ ) such that the student considers the following three possible outcomes to be equally likely: $X \\\\leq x_{2}, x_{2}<X<x_{3}$, and $X \\\\geq x_{3}$. Determinations of more than three outcomes that are considered to be equally likely can also be made. The different values of $x_{1}$ determined by different members of the class should be discussed, and also the possibility of getting the class to agree on a common value of $x_{1}$.\\n\\nSimilar determinations of equally likely outcomes can be made by the students in the class for quantities such as the following ones which were found in the 1973 World Almanac and Book of Facts: the number of freight cars that were in use by American railways in $1960(1,690,396)$, the number of banks in the United States which closed temporarily or permanently in 1931 on account of financial difficulties $(2,294)$, and the total number of telephones which were in service in South America in $1971(6,137,000)$.\\n\\n'})"
